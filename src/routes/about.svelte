    <p>I am a fullstack software engineer; interested in web3 and smart contract development. I graduated from the <span class='text-neutral-100/90 font-normal'>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</span> in 2020 with a <span class='text-neutral-100/90 font-normal'>Bachelor of Science in Econometrics & Quantitative Economics</span>. I entered university as a computer science student, but pivoted to study data-science and other quantitative fields while programming in my free time.</p>
    <p>I started working at a Chicago-based healthcare company in 2020, where I gained experience in large-scale enterprise software. This is where I learned my first front-end framework, Angular - which inspired my passion for front-end development. I worked on the DevOps team as a fullstack engineer and front-end lead; maintaining and writing new Java Spring Boot backend APIs for managing user authentication.</p>
